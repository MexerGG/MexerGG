- Hello I'm Mexer from Poland started programming 1 year ago and I really like it trying to create new projects and learn as much as I can
- I’m interested in programming also I like to watch and sometimes play games but mainly I program some apps that I want to use later
- I’m currently learning java. I decided to start leraning java because kotlin comes from it and I want to learn the basic then go to kotlin and start creating some android apps with it
- I'd like to cooperate with someone at some point but I don't think I'm good enough and the moment
- If u want to contact me just dm me at discord MexerGG#2204
